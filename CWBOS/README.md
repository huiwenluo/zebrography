# CW-BOS imaging of high intensity ultrasonic pressure fields.


In this study, there are three parts to quantitatively map focuced-ultrasound (FUS) pressure fields based on CW-BOS imaging.

1. [CW-BOS simulations](https://github.com/wgrissom/zebrography/blob/master/CWBOS/CWBOS_simulations/demo_Simulations.m): Perform numerical FUS beam simulations and generate the training data. 

2. [CW-BOS acquistion and hardware](https://github.com/wgrissom/zebrography/tree/master/CWBOS/CWBOS_acquistion): Acquire FUS-photo by CW-BOS system. 

3. [Reconstruction](https://github.com/wgrissom/zebrography/tree/master/CWBOS/recon): Train deep neural network, process the acquired acutal photo by CW-BOS system and reconstruct root-mean-square(RMS) projected pressure by pre-trained neural network.
